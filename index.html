    <h1><u>Data Privacy and Awareness Campaign</u></h1>
    <br>
    <h2><p>As the internet grows, so does the need for proper data privacy and awareness for a safe browsing experience. The Data Privacy and Awareness Campaign has taught me and many others to keep your information secure and private to avoid identity theft. Sharing your location, address, contact number, and other personal information on social media is also a no-go as it can lead to various people using that information for various cyber-crimes over the internet. Phishing and smishing can also be avoided if the user is aware of the precautionary steps that have been taught by the instructor on the data privacy and awareness campaign. Such a step is thinking before you click. We need to be mindful that not all links lead to a safe website or link. Some of these links can cause computer malware and can thus lead to your private data getting exposed over the internet. The instructor also briefly talked about minding your digital footprint over the internet, because the same as the other topics, leaving unwanted digital footprints over the internet can lead to privacy leakage that can cause unwanted cyber-crimes to happen to a user. To avoid such cyber-crimes and private data leakage, using strong passwords and changing them should be a habit that is exercised thoroughly. </p></h2>
    <br>
    <h2><p>The Campaign introduced two pieces of legislation that are the core topic of the lesson. Republic Act No. 10175 also known as the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 additionally penalizes offenses that violate the privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems, such as unauthorized access, system interference, data interference, device misuse, and cybersquatting. In this context, cybersquatting is defined as the acquisition of domain names on the internet in bad faith or to profit, deceive, harm one's reputation, or prevent others from registering or creating accounts under the domain name in question. In addition, the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 applies to all forms of digital fraud, computer-related forgery, and identity theft. The Republic Act No. 10173 recognizes the critical significance of information and communication technology in national development. It established the National Privacy Commission, which is responsible for implementing and ensuring compliance with the international data protection standards outlined in the Republic Act. The Republic Act establishes the regulatory framework to ensure that people's privacy is respected. It enumerates the conditions for lawful processing of personal information, data subjects' rights, and the personal information controller's responsibility in implementing reasonable measures to protect personal information against unlawful processing.</p></h2>
    <br>
    <h2><p>In this digital age, I realize that this Data Privacy and Awareness Campaign is very valuable for protecting personal information. I can apply this not just as a computer science student but also as a digitally literate and responsible social media user. This campaign educates individuals and raises awareness about the importance of data privacy rights and cybercrime, it also encourages people to be careful when sharing their data because the internet is not a safe place. </p></h2>
